Troubleshooting
---------------

1. The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit provides a development environment for
   creating high performance GPU-accelerated applications. With the CUDA
   Toolkit, you can develop, optimize and deploy your applications on
   GPU-accelerated embedded systems, desktop workstations, enterprise
   data centers, cloud-based platforms and HPC supercomputers. The
   toolkit includes GPU-accelerated libraries, debugging and
   optimization tools, a C/C++ compiler and a runtime library to deploy
   your application. This package consists of a post-install script that
   downloads and installs the full cuda toolkit(compiler, libraries,
   with the exception of cuda drivers).

-  Install CUDA-Development Toolkit with:

.. code:: bash

   cudatoolkit-dev

3. Anaconda tips:

-  Upgrade to latest packages from specific WMLCE version (1.6.0, 1.6.1,
   1.6.2, 1.7.x)

.. code:: bash

   echo "powerai-release ==1.6.1" >> $CONDA_DIR/conda-meta/pinned
   conda update --all

-  Upgrade previously-pinned env to latest WMLCE

.. code:: bash

   conda update powerai --no-pin
   conda update --all

4. WMLE installation when running for the first time

.. code:: bash

   conda install powerai

is posible to get the following error:

.. code:: bash

   CondaHTTPError: HTTP 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR for url <https://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/server/ibm-ai/conda/linux-ppc64le/current_repodata.json>
   Elapsed: 00:00.515998

   A remote server error occurred when trying to retrieve this URL.

   A 500-type error (e.g. 500, 501, 502, 503, etc.) indicates the server failed to
   fulfill a valid request.  The problem may be spurious, and will resolve itself if you
   try your request again.  If the problem persists, consider notifying the maintainer
   of the remote server.

to overcome this issue please re-enter your conda command.
