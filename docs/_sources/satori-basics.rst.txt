Satori Basics
=============

What is Satori?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Satori is a GPU dense, high-performance Power 9 system developed as a collaboration between MIT and IBM.
It has 64 1TB memory Power 9 nodes. Each node hosts four NVidia V100 32GB memory GPU cards. Within a 
node GPUs are linked by an NVLink2 network that supports nearly 200GB/s bi-directional transfer
between GPUs. A 100Gb/s Infiniband network with microsecond user space latency connects the cluster 
nodes togehter. 

How can I get an account?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. 
     Anyone with active MIT Kerberos credentials (i.e. all students, employees and sponsored 
     guest account https://ist.mit.edu/guest-accounts ) can connect to the Satori portal and create a starter account. A
     starter account is provided somewhat limited access by default. Once a starter account has been created research 
     group leads may request an account be added to one or more projects that can provide larger scale access.  
   
**Satori is currently in a beta test phase**. Access requires active MIT Kerberos credentials (available to all students, employees and sponsored guest accounts https://ist.mit.edu/guest-accounts ). To have your kereberos account activated on Satori during the beta test phase contact Chris Hill ( cnh@mit.edu ) or John Cohn ( johncohn@us.ibm.com ). 

Once beta testing is complete, anyone with active MIT Kerberos credentials (i.e. all students, employees and sponsored 
guest account https://ist.mit.edu/guest-accounts ) will be able to connect to Satori via a portal and a 
starter account will be created. A starter account will be provided somewhat limited access by default. Once a starter account has been created, an account holder can be added as a member to one or more research groups. Different research groups can provide larger scale access to their members.
