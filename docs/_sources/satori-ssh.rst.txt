Satori Login
============

You can connect to Satori through 

* a web portal, or 

* plain ssh from a terminal or a terminal client like PuTTY (https://www.putty.org). 

Web Portal Login
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use the web portal

#. Navigate to https://satori-portal.mit.edu in your favorite web browser.

#. Select the Globus Auth button.

#. When redirected to globus, authenticate via Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

#. When successfully logged in, you will be redirected back to Satori Portal! 


you can then launch Jupyter notebook environments running on GPUs 


#. Select "Jupyter Notebook" from the "Interactive Apps" dropdown in the top navbar. You can also select "My Interactive Sessions".

#. At the prompt to launch a Jupyter notebook, select the "Anaconda 2019.10 PowerAI [Experimental]" option in the "Choose Anaconda Environment" section. 

#. Enter (in hours) how long you would like the app to run for. 

#. Click launch, wait for app to begin running on a compute node and finally, select "Connect to Jupyter"!

the web portal also has sub-menus for

#. a terminal on the front-end node (**Clusters** menu)

#. a running job monitoring window (**Jobs** menu). This is also has a batch job preparation form, but
   it is malfunction at the moment! 
   
#. a file browsing and transfer client (**Files** menu)

SSH Login
^^^^^^^^^

-  Login to Satori cluster is done via SSHv2 as follow:

.. code:: bash

   ssh your_username@satori-login-001.mit.edu

.. code:: bash

   ssh your_username@satori-login-002.mit.edu

-  To copy files from your workstation to Satori you can use SCP,
   `WinSCP <https://winscp.net/eng/download.php>`__,
   `Cyberduck <https://cyberduck.io/download/>`__ etc

.. code:: bash

   scp <local-file.py> your_username@satori-login-001.mit.edu:

-  Once connected through ssh if you are familiar with tools like LSF you can start
   interactive or batch scripts e.g.

.. code:: bash

   bsub -ISp -tty -q short /bin/bash
   bsub -q short < myjobscript.lsf
   
   
If you are not familiar with LSF and cluster there are tutorial examples in other pages
of this document that can help show how to get started. 

As general rules:

-  satori-login-001.mit.edu - should be used for submiting training jobs
   and related activities
-  satori-login-002.mit.edu - should be used for transfering large
   files/datasets and compiling software requiring nvcc, gcc, XL
   compiler etc
-  if one login-node will not be available try the second one
-  donâ€™t run large computations on the login nodes


In case you want to work with Jupyter Notebooks but cannot use the https://satori-portal.mit.edu portal, you will 
need to forward Jupyter HTTP ports to your own workstation via SSHv2 tunneling.
This can be done like this: (Note FQDN == Fully Qualified Domain Name like nodeXXXX  for the node you are running on (E.g. node0014)

.. code:: bash 

   ssh -L 10001:<compute_node_FQDN>:10001 your_username@satori-login-001.mit.edu
   jupyter notebook --ip=<compute_node_FQDN> --port=10001
   
if you do this, remember to activate whatever conda enviroment you wish to use before starting ``jupyter`` e.g

.. code:: bash 

   
   conda activate wmlce-1.6.2
