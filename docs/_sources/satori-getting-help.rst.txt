Getting help on Satori 
======================

Email help
^^^^^^^^^^

If you need help with anything , please email satori-support@techsquare.com . Tech support
is mostly normal business hours, so responses are usually quicker during regular work hours. 
Response times during the night and over weekend and holidays (or when there is a lot going on!)
can be slower.  

The technical support team are familiar with some aspects of applications software and are
always willing to help. For some things though, like troubleshooting advanced AI workflows, it
can be good to reach out to other people using the system as they may have useful advice/tricks. 
The Satori slack channel is available for connecting everyone on Satori in a more free-form way.

Slack
^^^^^

A Slack channel for advice, discussion, advanced problem solving and more is available to all Satorians.
You can connect to the channel `here <https://mit-satori.slack.com/>`_ . To request an invite to
te Slack channel follow this `link <https://join.slack.com/t/mit-satori/shared_invite/enQtOTE2Mjk2NTc3MTI0LWNmZTAwMGFlM2NlZWMyZjUwOGExMTg1Mjg2ZmUzODIxMzM5YzkzNTE0NmJhZTc2NzhlZTExZmU3MWY5ZWNjZWQ>`_ . 

Slack or satori-support@techsquare.com
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For basic things, like *I can't log in* an email to satori-support@techsquare.com is probably best. For more involved things like *Does anyone know how to make Horovod do parallel I/O properly* the Slack channel may be more useful. 

Satori Office Hours
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We hold bi-weekly open office hours for Satori help at 3PM Monday and Thursday . Meeting info is https://mit.zoom.us/j/93373393960 password 466932 . Come join us !

Tips and Tricks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a Tips and Tricks section in the Satori documentation web pages. That can be a useful place to find out 
specific weird commands or environment variables that have proved useful. If you have material to contribute there, please
feel free to add things via Git.
