Acceptable Use and Code of Conduct
==================================

Satori is operated by the MIT Research Computing Project ( https://researchcomputing.mit.edu)
and certain appropriate common sense rules apply to working on it. 

Acceptable Use Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Satori resource is intended for research associated with MIT projects or collaborations around
MIT research projects. That can cover a lot of things, but all account holders are expected
to use judgement and apply common sense to their use of the system. The system is not
to be used to support commercial activities or for non-MIT related activities. It is not
to be used for anything that might be construed as illegal or criminal. Datasets on
the system must have been obtained legitimately and the system is not to be used
for working with unanonymized data or data subject to ITAR or other national security 
restrictions. If you are unsure about a planned use, please feel
free to contact satori-support@techsquare.com. 

Account holders should not share accounts and should take reasonable precautions to ensure 
that credentials for accessing the system (passwords, ssh keys etc...) are kept secure. 
All account holders agree to respect requests from support staff around how they use 
the system. The support staff may, as needed, impose whatever policies are required
to ensure the system runs well for all projects on the system. 

Code of Conduct
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Satori system is a shared resource used by a wide community. All people involved in
its use and operations should try their utmost to be courteous at all times. Members of the 
Satori  community should be respectful toward one another and endeavor to ensure a 
welcoming and collegial environment for all. Account holders are also expected to respect
privacy of others activities on the system, and not to try to gain access to parts of the
system they are not explicitly authorized to access.
