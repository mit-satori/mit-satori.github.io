Satori Login
============

You can connect to Satori through 

* a web portal that uses the open source Open On Demand ( https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/master/architecture.html ) software, or 

* through plain ssh from a terminal or a terminal client like PuTTY (https://www.putty.org). 

Web Portal Login
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use the web portal

#. Navigate to https://satori-portal.mit.edu in your favorite web browser.

#. Select the Globus Auth button.

#. When redirected to globus, authenticate via Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

#. When successfully logged in, you will be redirected back to Satori Portal! 


you can then launch Jupyter notebook environments running on GPUs 


#. Select "Jupyter Notebook" from the "Interactive Apps" dropdown in the top navbar. You can also select "My Interactive Sessions".

#. At the prompt to launch a Jupyter notebook, select the "Anaconda 2019.10 PowerAI [Experimental]" option in the "Choose Anaconda Environment" section. 

#. Enter (in hours) how long you would like the app to run for. 

#. Click launch, wait for app to begin running on a compute node and finally, select "Connect to Jupyter"!

the web portal also has sub-menus for

#. a terminal on the front-end node (**Clusters** menu)

#. a running job monitoring window (**Jobs** menu). This is also has a batch job preparation form, but
   it is malfunction at the moment! 
   
#. a file browsing and transfer client (**Files** menu)

-  Login to Satori cluster is done via SSHv2 as follow:

.. code:: bash

   ssh your_username@satori-login-001.mit.edu

.. code:: bash

   ssh your_username@satori-login-002.mit.edu

-  To copy files from your workstation to Satori you can use SCP,
   `WinSCP <https://winscp.net/eng/download.php>`__,
   `Cyberduck <https://cyberduck.io/download/>`__ etc

.. code:: bash

   scp <local-file.py> your_username@satori-login-001.mit.edu:

-  Once connected through ssh if you are familiar with tools like LSF you can start
   interactive or batch scripts. 

.. code:: bash

   bsub -ISp -tty -q normal /bin/bash
   
   scp ResNet50-Keras.py florin@satori-login-002.mit.edu:
   ssh florin@satori-login-002.mit.edu
   conda activate wmlce-1.6.2
   python ResNet50-Keras.py
   
If you are not familiar with LSF and cluster use take a look at the tutorial examples in other sections 
of this document. 

As general rules:

-  satori-login-001.mit.edu - shuld be used for submiting training jobs
   and related activities
-  satori-login-002.mit.edu - shuld be used for transfering large
   files/datasets and compiling software requireing nvcc, gcc, XL
   compiler etc
-  if one login-node will not be available try the second one
-  donâ€™t run trainings on login nodes
