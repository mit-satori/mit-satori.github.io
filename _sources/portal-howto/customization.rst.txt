Creating your own Jupyter kernels for OOD portal
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The OOD portal has a set of centrally installed Jupyter kernels that
include common software. The software is supposed to include most
things needed for frequently used tools. Sometimes you will come across
packages that are missing and see a message like this image

When this happens it is possible to create a custom kernel yourself
that will be included in the OOD menu for your account. That kernel can
include any available software you want.
