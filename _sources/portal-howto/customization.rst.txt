Creating your own Jupyter kernels for OOD portal
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The OOD portal has a set of centrally installed Jupyter kernels that
include common software. The software is supposed to include most

that will be included in the OOD menu for your account. That kernel can
include any available software you want.
