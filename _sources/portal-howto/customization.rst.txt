How can I create custom Jupyter kernels for the Satori web portal?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Open On Demand (OOD) Satori portal has a set of centrally installed Jupyter kernels that
include common software. The aims is to cover most
things needed for frequently used tools. If you start using
the portal extensively, sometimes you will come across
packages that are missing and see a message like this image

This is a sad moment, but inevtiable because people keep creating new and exciting
packages and it is hard for the central repository to keep up. 
Fortunately it is possible to create a custom kernel yourself.
This kernel will then be included in the OOD launcher options for your account alongside
the standard kernels. A kernel you create can
include any available software you can figure out how to install. The instructions on this
page show you how to go about creating your own kernel. 

*Note* you can also request that 
modules be added to one of the standard environments or that a new standard environment
be added. The standard modues do evolve and new software is added as it the administration
group becomes aware of them. Sometimes, however, getting a module added to the standard environment 
requires waiting a little, or the module may conflict with something else. 

By learning how to add your own kernels you can avoid having to wait and work around
any incompatibilities. You can also gather customized, versioned sets of tools into 
a standard kernels that can then be shared within a group working on a common 
project, or that you can request be added for your group to a standard set. This can
be more efficient than having to wait for something to installed centrally every
time you find a new awesome package that all the cool people are using. 

An additional benefit of knowing how to create your own kernels is that it can help with sharing and reproducibility
of results. Strict versioning and maintaining historic kernels in perpetuity in central locations 
can easily become an impractical combinatorial challenge. Creating
precise kernels that collect specific version combinations of software in an 
immutable state in a per account location can help, although this still requires care and
diligence!

Steps to create a kernel
========================

These instructions assume you are slightly familiar with conda ( https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/index.html ), that you are
starting a brand new conda environment for this kernel. The steps involve a series of terminal commands and assume 
you are familiar with working at the terminal command line ( if you are not you can ask someone for 
help and can also find tutorials on line https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/ ). There is a terminal
available in the OOD portal, under the **Clusters** pull-down.

we will use the OOD terminal for executing the steps needed for a custom kernel. Alternatively, the same steps
can be carried out when logged in from an ssh session, for example via the command line
``ssh -l USER satori-login-001.mit.edu`` of through a client like PuTTY.

To create our new kernel we will  

#. **Create** a brand new, clean conda environment in a new directory
  
#. **Activate** the environment and install the packages we need
  
#. **Initialise** the interactive python settings for the new environment

Commands to create a new conda environment with a custom Python kernel
----------------------------------------------------------------------

#. **Create.** The bash shell commands create a new conda environment. This example uses the account name ``cnh``. The new 
   environment is placed in a new directory under the scratch space ``/nobackup/users/cnh/projects/condas`` belonging to 
   the account ``cnh``. The new environment is named ``cnh-awesome-new-environment``. These values can be changed for 
   different accounts and ways of organizing files. The command sequence starts with ``conda deactivate`` to prevent
   inadvertantly overwriting and existing conda environment. If conda is not already activted then the message ``conda:
   command not found`` may be printed. That is OK::


   
        CKNAME=cnh-awesome-new-environment
        CKUSER=cnh
        CKROOT=projects/condas
        conda deactivate
        mkdir -p /nobackup/users/${CKUSER}/${CKROOT}/${CKNAME}
        cd /nobackup/users/${CKUSER}/${CKROOT}/${CKNAME}
        wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-4.7.12.1-Linux-ppc64le.sh
        chmod +x Miniconda2-4.7.12.1-Linux-ppc64le.sh
        ./Miniconda2-4.7.12.1-Linux-ppc64le.sh -b -p `pwd`/miniconda3
        . miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
        conda config --prepend channels https://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/server/ibm-ai/conda/
   
   
   **NOTE** - the conda commands tend to hard code full path names as part of their installation. So, once the **Create** step
   is complete, renaming or moving the install directory 
   ( ``/nobackup/users/cnh/projects/condas/cnh-awesome-new-environment`` in this example) will break the setup. 
   
#. **Activate.** Once the new conda environment has been created in its own directory, make sure the shell still has the 
   correct settings and then *activate* the environment in the terminal shell session using the following commands::

      CKNAME=cnh-awesome-new-environment
      CKUSER=cnh
      CKROOT=projects/condas
      cd /nobackup/users/${CKUSER}/${CKROOT}/${CKNAME}
      export PATH="`pwd`/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"
      . miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
      conda create -y --name ${CKNAME} python=3.6
      conda activate ${CKNAME}
      
   **NOTE** - the conda environment **activate** step applies to the terminal shell session in which 
   the **activate** commands are run. If you start a new terminal or shell you will need to rerun the activate step before
   exectuing the **install** commands.
   
#. **Install.** Once the conda environment has been **created** and is **activated** in the terminal shell the final step 
   involves running install commands in the shell. In the example shown here we will install the IBM ``powerai`` 
   software stack and add ``keras`` (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/keras), ``patsy`` (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/patsy), 
   ``seaborn`` ( https://anaconda.org/anaconda/seaborn ), ``statsmodels`` ( https://anaconda.org/anaconda/statsmodels )
   and ``netcdf4`` (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/netcdf4). All except ``netcdf4`` are currently in a standard 
   kernel on Satori. We include an environment variable ``IBM_POWERAI_LICENSE_ACCEPT=yes`` so that we can run things
   without interaction. The final commands needed are then::
   
      
      CKNAME=cnh-awesome-new-environment
      CKUSER=cnh
      CKROOT=projects/condas
      cd /nobackup/users/${CKUSER}/${CKROOT}/${CKNAME}
      export PATH="`pwd`/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"
      . miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
      conda activate ${CKNAME}
      export IBM_POWERAI_LICENSE_ACCEPT=yes
      conda install -y powerai
      conda install -y keras patsy seaborn netcdf4
      pip install --user ipykernel
      python -m ipykernel install --user --name=${CKNAME}
      
   This creates a new kernel we can start from in the OOD Jupyter launcher. It should be visible, under the name given by 
   ``${CKNAME}`` , when a new Jupyter session is started. 
   
An added bonus - updating on the fly
------------------------------------

Once you have created a new kernel conda environment it is ownde by your account, so it can be updated if needed. This 
is unlike the standard system kernels which are currently read-only. For example in the example above the kernel 
environment does not include ``cuml`` ( https://anaconda.org/rapidsai/cuml ). The ``cuml`` package can be used to 
greatly accelerate TSNE dimensionality reduction 
( see - https://medium.com/rapids-ai/tsne-with-gpus-hours-to-seconds-9d9c17c941db ), so it may be neded at some point e.g. 
when an import like ``from cuml.manifold import TSNE`` fails. Rather than going through the entire **Create**, 
**Activate**, **Install** sequence from scratch we can update in a Terminal within Jupyter and then reestart our 
kernel. The commands for this are::

   CKNAME=cnh-awesome-new-environment
   CKUSER=cnh
   CKROOT=projects/condas
   cd /nobackup/users/${CKUSER}/${CKROOT}/${CKNAME}
   export PATH="`pwd`/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"
   . miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
   conda activate ${CKNAME}
   conda install cuml
   
   
when this completes we can restart the kernel and the new package will be avaiable.

   
Some additional steps for Julia and Octave
------------------------------------------

Additionally we might want to include a Julia interactive environment and an Octave interactive environment. This section should document more about how that works. This content is still under development::

  
      module load julia/1.3.0
      julia -E 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("IJulia")'
      
Files and directories
---------------------

There are several files and directories that are useful to know about. This section will provide some details on these. Some of the key files are listed below. This section is still under development::

   ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/cnh-awesome-new-environment/
   ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/cnh-awesome-new-environment/kernel.json
   ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/julia-1.3
